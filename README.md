## 👋 Welcome!

Hey there! I'm Mahendra, and I've been exactly where you are right now.

If you're a complete beginner who's never written a line of code, **you're in the right place**. This course starts from absolute zero - no experience required!

I created this learning path because I remember struggling to find resources that truly started from the beginning. Most courses assume you know things, skip steps, or jump too quickly into complex topics. This one doesn't.

We'll start by creating your very first webpage with HTML, gradually build up your skills through CSS and JavaScript, master TypeScript, and finally dive deep into React to build modern, professional applications.

**This is the resource I wish I had when I started.** 🎯
