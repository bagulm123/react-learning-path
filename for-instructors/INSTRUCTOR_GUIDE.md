## 👋 A Note to Fellow Educators

Hey there, fellow teacher!

First off – thanks for using this course to guide students through React. I built this curriculum from real teaching experience, including all the "why isn't this working?" moments we've all had with students.

This isn't one of those "here's the content, figure it out yourself" resources. I've included:
- Assessment rubrics
- Common student questions (and answers!)
- Teaching tips for different learning styles
- Timeline flexibility for different program lengths
- Ways to adapt this to your teaching style

Feel free to modify anything to fit your needs. The goal is student success, not rigid rule-following.

Let's create some awesome React developers together! 🚀

**- Mahendra**

Regular code reviews help students learn from mistakes.

### 3. Encourage Exploration
Let students try different approaches and learn from failures.

### 4. Build a Community
Create a Discord/Slack for students to help each other.

### 5. Showcase Projects
Create a gallery of completed projects to motivate students.

### 6. Pair Programming
Encourage students to work in pairs occasionally.

### 7. Real-World Context
Relate assignments to real-world applications.

### 8. Celebrate Progress
Acknowledge improvements, not just perfection.
