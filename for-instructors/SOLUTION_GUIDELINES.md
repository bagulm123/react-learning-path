# 💡 Solution Guidelines for Instructors

**By Mahendra Bagul** | For Teaching & Mentoring

Hey fellow instructor! 👋

These are guidelines for helping students, not complete solutions to hand over. I've learned (sometimes the hard way) that students learn best when they struggle a bit, then find their own path with guidance.

Your job isn't to give them the answer – it's to help them discover it. These guidelines will help you do that effectively.

**Golden Rule:** Guide, don't code! 🎓

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Don't Share Complete Solutions** - Students learn by building, not copying
2. **Guide, Don't Code** - Help students find solutions rather than giving answers
3. **Encourage Exploration** - Multiple approaches can be correct
4. **Focus on Concepts** - Understanding matters more than exact implementation

## 🔍 Debugging Help Guidelines

When students ask for help:

### 1. Ask Diagnostic Questions
- What did you expect to happen?
- What actually happened?
- What have you tried so far?
- What error message are you seeing?

### 2. Guide Their Investigation
- Check browser console
- Check React DevTools
- Check network tab for API calls
- Check Redux DevTools (if applicable)

### 3. Teach Debugging Skills
- How to read error messages
- How to use console.log effectively
- How to use breakpoints
- How to isolate the problem

### 4. Provide Hints, Not Answers
❌ "Change line 25 to `useState(false)`"  
✅ "What's the initial state of your toggle? What should it be?"

## 📚 Teaching Common Patterns

### useState Pattern
```typescript
// Explain: state, setState function, initial value
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

### useEffect Pattern
```typescript
// Explain: side effects, dependencies, cleanup
useEffect(() => {
  // Effect logic
  return () => {
    // Cleanup
  };
}, [dependency]);
```

### Custom Hook Pattern
```typescript
// Explain: reusable stateful logic
function useCustomHook(initialValue) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);
  // Hook logic
  return [value, setValue];
}
```
