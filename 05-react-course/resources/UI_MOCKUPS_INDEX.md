# 🎨 UI Mockups Index

**By Mahendra Bagul**

Before you write a single line of code, look at these mockups! 👀

I'm a big believer in "see it, then build it." These mockups show you exactly what you're aiming for – the layouts, components, and user flows. They'll save you hours of "wait, what should this look like?" moments.

Think of these as your architectural blueprints. Build from these, not from imagination! 📐
